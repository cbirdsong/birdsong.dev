<section class="lead" id="intro">

<p class="lead"><strong>I build websites</strong> that are accessible, performant, responsive, user-centric and beautiful.</p>

I have a keen eye for detail and love laboring over sites to get them _just right_.

I have extensive experience collaborating with designers to strike the perfect balance between form and function.

I'm always looking for new, more efficient ways to get my job done.

## I write:

- accessible and semantic **<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>**
- reusable and performant **<abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>**, Sass and Less
- just enough **JavaScript**, applied as progressive enhancement

## I've worked with:

- **Templating languages** like Liquid, Twig and Nunjucks
- **Git**, via Bitbucket
- **<abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>**, for hand-coding animations, transitions and optimization
- **WordPress**, building themes from scratch in both standard PHP and using Twig via **[Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/)**
- **[Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/)**, building pattern libraries for design systems
- **HubSpot**, building custom landing pages and email templates, customizing form embeds
- **Google Analytics** and **Google Tag Manager**, implemented as performantly as possible

<summary>I've also worked with:</summary>

- **Photoshop**, **Illustrator** and **Sketch**
