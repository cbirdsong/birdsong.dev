## Portfolio

2M-Tek ([2m-tek.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423202347/http://2m-tek.com))

Worked closely with a designer to make client’s request for a bold handcrafted design a reality.

**Notable features**: Vertically rotated primary nav with "dropdown" menu. Cutting-edge use of `<canvas>`\-based script on images with headings to replicate Photoshop blend modes before their CSS implementations. Striking [custom Google Maps skin](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423202347/http://www.2m-tek.com/contact/). Novel [form/button styling](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423202347/http://www.2m-tek.com/contact/).

**Favorite details**: Scroll speeds vary between the image and text columns. The image with a heading and the content area text align with the active primary nav item. Accent lines on the right viewport edge align with the borders on the first few paragraph or heading tags in content area text.

**How I’d do it better**: Switching to CSS-based animation for the menu pop-out would make it move as smoothly as scrolling. Using new CSS-based blend modes would improve page load time.

Downtown Lafayette ([downtownlafayette.org](http://downtownlafayette.org))

Worked with client and external design firm to match the site with new logo and branding. Won Addy award for mobile site. Runner-up for desktop site.

**Notable features**: Built [client-editable location database](http://www.downtownlafayette.org/eat-drink-shop-sleep/#Eat) and rendered it onto a custom-skinned Google Map with filtering by category and search-as-you-type.

**Favorite details**: The custom map pins for each type of business.

**How I’d do it better**: Some areas of this design have not stood up to the client’s editing, most notably the amount of text in the location descriptions on [this view](http://www.downtownlafayette.org/eat-drink-shop-sleep/#Eat) and the filters on [this view](http://www.downtownlafayette.org/eat-drink-shop-sleep/#More). I’d try to make it more flexible, which would be easier with modern tools like flexbox or grid.

New Mexican Kennels ([newmexicankennels.com](http://newmexicankennels.com))

**Notable features**: Modular and flexible design allowed for rich individual pages created from handcrafted components. Sticky nav menu items each had customize and hand-tuned contents in the side pop-out menu.

**Favorite details**: Custom cursor on Reservations call to action.

**How I’d do it better**: Add a newsletter signup area so the client might not insist on adding and then endlessly repurposing a modal popup.
