<section class="lead" id="intro">

<p class="lead">I build websites that are <strong>accessible</strong>, <strong>performant</strong>, <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>user-centric</strong> and <strong>beautiful</strong>.</p>

I have a keen eye for detail and love laboring over sites to get them _just right_.

I have extensive experience collaborating with designers to strike the perfect balance between form and function.

I'm always looking for new ways to produce higher quality work more efficiently.
